# Configuration Rules (beta)

Configuration Rules allow you to customize certain Cloudflare [configuration settings](/rules/configuration-rules/settings/) for matching incoming requests.

The Configuration Rule expression will determine to which requests the rule settings will apply. For more information on expressions, refer to [Expressions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) and [Edit rule expressions](/firewall/cf-dashboard/edit-expressions/).
